title: "Why Getting Into CMU Meant So Much To Me"

Getting accepted into the **Master of Science in Robotics (MRSD)** program at **Carnegie Mellon University** wasn’t just an academic milestone for me — it was a deeply personal turning point.

For years, my career has been shaped by one guiding idea: *robots should be able to operate reliably in the real world*.  
During my work on autonomous drones, I saw up close how complex, unpredictable, and unforgiving field environments can be. Offshore winds, vibration, lighting changes, GPS outages — these are things no textbook fully prepares you for.

I knew that if I wanted to build systems that truly mattered, I needed a place where theory meets real-world deployment, where robotics is treated as an interdisciplinary craft, not just an academic subject.

And for me, that place was **CMU**.

## Why CMU Was the Goal

CMU’s robotics ecosystem is unlike anything else: research groups pushing the boundaries of autonomous flight, the legendary RI culture, the focus on systems engineering, and the sheer density of people building robots — *not just talking about them*.

What drew me most to MRSD was its philosophy:

> **Build robots that work, reliably, repeatedly, and in the real world.**

That was exactly the gap I wanted to bridge.

Coming from industry and UAV development, I felt comfortable with practical deployment — but I wanted deeper mastery in:

- **Perception systems** that work under all conditions  
- **Robust motion planning** for aerial and ground robots  
- **System integration** at a scale I hadn’t handled before  
- **State estimation**, **SLAM**, and advanced **robotics math**  
- **Designing autonomy with safety guarantees**, not just heuristics  

CMU offered a structured way to transform my experience into a stronger, more complete engineering foundation.

## What I Want to Achieve Here

My goal at CMU is simple:

> **To become the kind of engineer who can architect full robotic systems — from algorithm to hardware to real-world deployment.**

More specifically:

### 1. Master the fundamentals that make autonomy trustworthy  
Not just "working in simulation," but working when the real world throws the unexpected at you.

### 2. Build systems end-to-end  
From ROS2 to controls to perception to planning — something CMU pushes you to do repeatedly.

### 3. Work with people who have done this before  
Professors, peers, alumni — many are shaping the future of field robotics, autonomy, and aerospace.

### 4. Prepare for a career in Field Robotics / UAV Autonomy  
Whether it’s in aerial logistics, UAM, defense systems, or planetary exploration — I want to build robots that have **impact**, not just novelty.

## A Personal Milestone

For me, getting into CMU wasn’t simply a university acceptance.  
It was validation that the years I spent tinkering with drones, debugging flight controllers at odd hours, and chasing reliable autonomy in unpredictable environments — *all of it meant something*.

It gave me a platform to grow beyond what I could teach myself or learn on the job.

And more than anything, it put me in an environment that demands excellence — something I’ve always wanted to be held accountable to.

## Looking Ahead

As I go through the program, I plan to share my projects, insights, and what I learn along the way — not just as a record, but hopefully as guidance for someone who is on the same path.

Robotics is hard.  
Field robotics is even harder.  
But that’s exactly why I’m here.

And this is just the beginning.
