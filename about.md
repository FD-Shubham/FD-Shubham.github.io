# About Me

*Add a photo of yourself here*

I’m **Shubham Saboo**, a budding **Robotics Engineer** specializing in **Field Robotics, UAV Autonomy, and Perception Systems**. I’m currently pursuing my **Master of Science in Robotics (MRSD)** at **Carnegie Mellon University**, where I focus on building robots that operate reliably in challenging real-world environments.

My journey began with hands-on drone development during my undergraduate years, eventually leading me to work as a **UAV Systems Engineer at F-drones**. There, I contributed to the development of long-range autonomous delivery aircraft, designed computer-vision landing systems, and optimized flight controls for offshore operations.

I’m passionate about:
- **Autonomy for Aerial and Ground Robots**
- **Motion Planning & Controls**
- **Computer Vision for Robotics**
- **System Integration & Field Deployment**
- **Energy & Performance Modeling of UAVs**

Robotics, for me, is not just about algorithms — it’s about building systems that *work*, even in imperfect conditions. My goal is to engineer autonomous systems that are safe, reliable, and impactful.

## My Mission

I want to create robotic systems that extend human capabilities — delivering supplies across oceans, navigating dangerous terrains, and operating where humans can’t.

At CMU, I’m working toward becoming a systems-oriented roboticist who can take a robot from **concept → simulation → hardware → real-world deployment**.

## Outside of Robotics

When I’m not debugging flight controllers or tuning PID loops, I enjoy:
- Writing and sharing my engineering journey
- Learning about electric aircraft & UAM
- Exploring robotics research trends
